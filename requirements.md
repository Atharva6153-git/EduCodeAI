# Code Samjhao AI – Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview
Code Samjhao AI is a learning-first AI-powered code explanation and debugging assistant designed especially for beginners and students in Bharat.  
The system helps users understand code line-by-line in simple language (English/Hinglish) with a focus on teaching concepts rather than just providing answers.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many students struggle to learn programming due to:
- Overly technical documentation
- Complex error messages
- Lack of beginner-friendly explanations
- English-only learning resources

Existing AI tools focus on productivity for developers, not on teaching beginners how and why code works.
